# Java Solutions

This directory contains all Java implementations for the NeetCode 150 problems.

## File Naming Convention

- Each problem solution is stored in its own directory named by problem number and a short description
- Example: `001_two_sum`
- Inside each directory:
  - `README.md` with problem description and approach
  - `Solution.java` with the Java implementation

## Java-Specific Notes

- Solutions are implemented in Java 11+ unless noted otherwise
- Standard Java collections and libraries are used where appropriate
- Each solution class includes comments explaining the approach

## Testing

Most solutions include a `main` method to demonstrate the solution with test cases.
