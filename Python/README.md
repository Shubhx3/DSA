# Python Solutions

This directory contains all Python implementations for the NeetCode 150 problems.

## File Naming Convention

- Each problem solution is stored in its own directory named by problem number and a short description
- Example: `001_two_sum`
- Inside each directory:
  - `README.md` with problem description and approach
  - `solution.py` with the Python implementation

## Python-Specific Notes

- Solutions are implemented in Python 3.8+ unless noted otherwise
- Standard Python libraries and data structures are used where appropriate
- Each solution includes comments explaining the approach

## Testing

Most solutions include test cases within the file to demonstrate the solution.
